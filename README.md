SimpleML
---
SimpleML provides implementations of basic machine learning algorithms in C#, and serves as a real-world use case of the [MMF framework](https://github.com/alastairwyse/MathematicsModularFramework/).

The implementations follow the examples given in the [Coursera Machine Learning course instructed by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

In SimpleML, MMF is used to combine these example algorithms into different permutations of machine learning workflows.
